## ðŸ’¡ About Myself:
---
Despite the fact that I have a law degree, I worked as a system administrator in a small company. Where, over time, I began to perform various tasks not related to administration. The most interesting of them, in my opinion, were related to design (both WEB and printing).        

The design somehow caught on. I started studying graphics programs, design techniques, color theories, and so on. At the moment I have 16 years of experience as a graphic designer in the automotive industry. My portfolio of works has everything: from business cards, badges, flyers, to posters, catalogs, streamers and huge boards.     

Since I work remotely, I can afford to learn something else creative in one way or another. That's how I came to Frontend Development.
